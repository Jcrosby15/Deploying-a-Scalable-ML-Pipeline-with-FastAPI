# Model Card

For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details
> Created to satisfy ML Devops course requirements as part of Udacity's nanodegree for Data Science. 
> Created 12/14/2024
>Version 1.0.0
>Using a Random Forest Classifier for the project


## Intended Use
> This is to serve as an example of deploying a ML Pipeline that is scalable to a production state, and to predict whether salary exceeds a cerain amount based on census data provided.

## Training Data
>With five folds, eighty percent of the data was used for training the model. 

## Evaluation Data
>With five folds, twenty percent of the data was used for evaluating the model. 

## Metrics
> We used three metrics for our data: Precision Score, Recall Score, and an F Beta Score. The results of each respectively are: 0.7768, 0.6237, 0.6919

## Ethical Considerations
> Little ethical concerns arise regarding this data and model. The data is public and the model is being deployed for academic purposes and not being used to make decisions.

## Caveats and Recommendations
> No further recommendations
